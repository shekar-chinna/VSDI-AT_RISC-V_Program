# VSDI-AT_RISC-V_Program
My weekly submissions for the VSD RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program. This repository is a record of my work and a testament to my commitment to mastering VLSI design and contributing to the open-source semiconductor ecosystem.

# ⚙️ Week 0: Program Kick-off & Tool Setup

This document serves as my submission for the Week 0 assessment of the VSD RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program. The tasks completed for this week include a summary of the the successful installation and verification of required open-source tools.

### :book: Task 1: Github Repo creation



* **Program Objectives & Scope:** The program is part of a larger, national initiative to advance India's semiconductor ecosystem. It aims to train over 3500 participants in the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow using open-source EDA tools.
* **Learning Path:** The curriculum is structured to take participants through every stage of chip design, from RTL design to synthesis, physical design, and culminating in a final tapeout.
* **Tools Focus:** The program emphasizes using an open-source EDA ecosystem, including tools like `iVerilog`, `Yosys`, `gtkwave`, and eventually, `OpenLane` for the physical design part.
* **Collaboration:** This is a collaborative effort between **VSD**, **IIT Gandhinagar**, and other key partners in the semiconductor industry.

### :gear: Task 2: Tools Installation

I have successfully installed and verified the  open-source tools as per the course instructions. 



### :bulb: Key Learnings from Week 0

This week provided a crucial foundation for the entire program. I successfully:

* Installed and verified open-source EDA tools that will be used for the entire program.
* Gained a clear understanding of the program's objectives, including the full RTL-to-GDSII flow.
* Prepared my local environment for the upcoming assignments, which will involve RTL design and simulation.
